# Nodemailer Readme

This code snippet  to use Nodemailer, a package for Node.js applications, to send email messages through a Gmail account.

## Usage

1. Install the `nodemailer` package with npm:

npm install nodemailer

2. Import the module in your code:

==javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
==

3. Create a reusable transporter object using the default SMTP transport:

==javascript
let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
        user: 'your_gmail_username@gmail.com',
        pass: 'your_gmail_password with 12 character generated in google security app password'
    }
});
==

Replace `your_gmail_username` and `your_gmail_password` with your own Gmail account credentials.

4. Customize the email data according to your needs:

==javascript
let mailOptions = {
    from: 'your_gmail_username@gmail.com',
    to: 'recipient_email_address@gmail.com',
    subject: 'Subject line of the email',
    text: 'Email message text'
};
==

Replace `recipient_email_address` with the email address of your recipient, and customize the other fields as necessary.

5. Send the email with the defined transporter object:

When the email is sent, the console will output the response message.
